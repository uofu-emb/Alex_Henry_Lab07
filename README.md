# Alex and Henry Lab 7

## Activity 0

We added a setup for LED0 to change state when the callback is called.

We also added a method within a thread to send a message

## Activity 1

We added a new send_message call that takes an ID and sends using that id and the callback takes a mask to prevent any id except the correct one from having a good callback.

## Activity 2
